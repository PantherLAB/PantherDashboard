## Panther Dashboard for DQMH: Supercharge Your LabVIEW Development with Enhanced Scripting and DQMH Project Analysis

Panther Dashboard for DQMH takes LabVIEW development to the next level by introducing a powerful suite of features for streamlined exploration, editing, code creation and documentation.

**Effortless Scripting for DQMH Tasks**

* **All DQMH Scripting tools are conveniently accessible at a single button click**

**Module Management:**

* **Edit Module Properties:** Modify module names and timeouts directly through the dashboard. Right-click on a module and select either 'Edit Module Name--constant.vi' or 'Edit Module Timeout--constant.vi' to execute a script that updates the corresponding constant VI within the module.

* **PantherLAB Scripting Tools:** Generate custom error and constant VIs tailored to your specific needs. Right-click on a module and choose 'Create Custom --error.vi' or 'Create Custom --constant.vi' to trigger a script that creates the VI within the selected module, these vis follows the DQMH Consortium Style Guidelines.

**Request and Wait for Reply Timeout Control:**

* **Fine-Tune Timeouts:**  Right-click on a 'Request and Wait for Reply' element and select 'Set Custom Timeout' to execute a script that allows you to define a custom timeout value. This provides granular control over individual request behaviors.
* **Revert to Module Default:** Need to restore the timeout to the module's default setting? Simply right-click on the element and select 'Restore to Module's Timeout' to run a script that sets the timeout back to the value defined in 'Module Timeout--constant.vi'.

**Project-Wide DQMH Analysis at Your Fingertips**

Panther Dashboard goes beyond basic project navigation. The new 'Show Project DQMH Info' feature, accessible through a right-click on the project, generates a valuable analysis report:

* **Module Constants in Detail:**  Gain insights into each module's configuration by extracting critical information like names and timeout values. This provides a quick understanding of module-specific parameters.
* **Helper Loop Visibility:**  Identify the number of helper loops within each module. This knowledge is instrumental in comprehending the processing flow and potential complexities within your project.
* **Dependency Mapping Made Easy:**   The 'Show Project DQMH Info' feature generates a dependency resume that lists launched modules for each module, offering a clear view of your Project sctructure.

**Important Note:**

While 'Show Project DQMH Info' provides a solid foundation for understanding your project's current state, PantherLAB recommends using Antidoc for exceptionally detailed and visually appealing documentation. Antidoc by Wovalab is an open-source powerful tool designed to generate comprehensive reports, and Panther Dashboard's scripting features can seamlessly integrate with it for a well-rounded documentation approach.# Additional Resources
